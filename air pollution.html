        <h1>Sustainable Transportation And Urban Planning Came Into Existance</h1>
       
        <p> <br>
            1. Early Concerns (Pre-1970s): <br> 
            a. Cities grew car-dependent, raising concerns about pollution and congestion.<br><br>
            2. The Rise of Sustainability (1970s-1990s)<br>
            a. The 1972 Stockholm Plan addressed alternative transportation needs.<br>
            b. The 1992 Rio Earth Summit acknowledged transport's impact on development.<br><br>
            3. Modern Push (1990s-Present):<br>
            a. Focus on electric vehicles, public transport, cleaner fuels, and walkable cities.<br>
            b. Sustainable urban planning emphasizes mixed-use development, green infrastructure, and public transportation.<br>

            <h1>Why we are not able to achieve sustainable transportation and urban planning?</h1><br>
<p1>There are several roadblocks on the path to sustainable transportation and urban planning:<br>
    1. One hurdle is car dependence. Cars offer convenience, but their dominance creates sprawl, making walking, cycling, and public transport less viable. This cycle fuels congestion and emissions.
<br>
2.Unequal access is another challenge. Sustainable options often aren't readily available in low-income areas, forcing residents to rely on personal vehicles. This creates an uneven burden of pollution and limits mobility for those who need it most.
<br>
3. Upfront costs can also be a barrier. Building robust public transit requires significant investment, and transitioning to clean energy sources  can be expensive.

            <!-- <h9>Primary Pollutants</h9><br>
          
        
       <p1>The pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary pollutants. Sulphur-dioxide emitted from factories is a primary pollutant.</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Secondary Pollutants</h9><br>
            <p>The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant.

            <h1>Diverse strategies that we can implement to achive sustainable transportation and urban planning are:</h1><br>

        
            <p1>1. Expanding and improving bus networks: Making buses more frequent, reliable, and affordable can entice people out of cars.<br>
                2. Developing light rail or subways: High-capacity rapid transit systems can efficiently move large numbers of people in densely populated areas.<br>
                3. Investing in infrastructure: Dedicated bus lanes, safe bike paths, and improved pedestrian crossings create a seamless network for alternative transportation.<br>
                4. Creating walkable and bikeable neighborhoods: Designing mixed-use developments with essential services within walking or cycling distance reduces car dependence.<br>
                5. Implementing bike-sharing programs: Making bicycles readily available encourages short trips and exploration.<br>
                6. Promoting pedestrian-friendly infrastructure: Wide sidewalks, proper lighting, and attractive streetscapes make walking more enjoyable.<br>
                7. Electrifying public transportation: Shifting buses and trains to electric power significantly reduces emissions.<br>
                8. Encouraging electric vehicles: Offering incentives for purchasing and charging electric cars can accelerate their adoption.<br>
                9. Investing in clean fuels: Promoting biofuels or hydrogen fuel cell technology can provide alternatives to traditional gasoline.<br>
                10.Revitalizing existing neighborhoods: Encouraging development within city centers reduces urban sprawl and promotes a more compact urban form.<br>

            <!-- <h9>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h9><br>
            <p1>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</p1><br><br>
            
            
            
            <h9>Automobiles</h9><br>
            <p1>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.

</p1><br><br> -->
             
            <!-- <h9>Agricultural Activities</h9><br>
            <p1>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.</p1><br><br>
            
            
            <h9>Factories and Industries</h9><br>
            <p1>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Mining Activities</h9><br>
            <p1>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.</p1><br><br> -->
            
            <h1>Eco-friendly transport: </h1><br>
            <p1>
                1.Car sharing: For example, with your work colleagues: sharing cars avoids the need to purchase and maintain them as well as the need to buy car insurance. <br>
                2.Efficient driving style: The style of driving also influences fuel usage. In this way, avoiding certain behaviours such as excess speed or deflated tyres allows one to reduce petrol consumption.

            <h9>Diseases</h9><br>
            <p1>Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. Many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution</p1><br><br>
            
            
            <h9>Global Warming
</h9><br>
            <p1>Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. This increase in earthâ€™s temperature is known as global warming. This has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Many areas are submerged underwater.</p1><br><br>
    <h9>Acid Rain</h9> <br>       
            <p1>The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides in the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic and fall as acid rain which damages human, animal and plant life.

</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Ozone Layer Depletion
</h9><br>
            <p1>The release of chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals.

            <!-- <h1>Air Pollution Control
</h1>
            <p1>Following are the measures one should adopt, to control air pollution:

</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Avoid Using Vehicles
</h9><br>
            <p1>People should avoid using vehicles for shorter distances. Rather, they should prefer public modes of transport to travel from one place to another. This not only prevents pollution, but also conserves energy.

</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Energy Conservation
</h9><br>
            <p1>A large number of fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. Therefore, do not forget to switch off the electrical appliances when not in use. Thus, you can save the environment at the individual level. Use of energy-efficient devices such as CFLs also controls pollution to a greater level.

</p1><br><br>
            
            <h9>Use of Clean Energy Resources
</h9><br>
            <p1>The use of solar, wind and geothermal energies reduce air pollution at a larger level. Various countries, including India, have implemented the use of these resources as a step towards a cleaner environment.<br><br>

Other air pollution control measures include:<br>

<br><br> -By minimising and reducing the use of fire and fire products.<br><br>
 -Since industrial emissions are one of the major causes of air pollution, the pollutants can be controlled or treated at the source itself to reduce its effects. For example, if the reactions of a certain raw material yield a pollutant, then the raw materials can be substituted with other less polluting materials.<br><br>
 -Fuel substitution is another way of controlling air pollution. In many parts of India, petrol and diesel are being replaced by CNG â€“ Compressed Natural Gas fueled vehicles. These are mostly adopted by vehicles that arenâ€™t fully operating with ideal emission engines.<br><br>
 -Although there are many practices in India, which focus on repairing the quality of air, most of them are either forgotten or not being enforced properly. There are still a lot of vehicles on roads which havenâ€™t been tested for vehicle emissions.<br><br>
 -Another way of controlling air pollution caused by industries is to modify and maintain existing pieces of equipment so that the emission of pollutants is minimised.<br><br>
 -Sometimes controlling pollutants at the source is not possible. In that case, we can have process control equipment to control the pollution.<br><br>
 -A very effective way of controlling air pollution is by diluting the air pollutants.<br><br>
 -The last and the best way of reducing the ill effects of air pollution is tree plantation. Plants and trees reduce a large number of pollutants in the air. Ideally, planting trees in areas of high pollution levels will be extremely effective.</p1>
