    <!-- <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites. </p> -->

        <h1>What is Sustainable Urban Planning?</h1>
       
        <p>Sustainable urban planning is the process of designing cities and towns that can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It's an approach to urban development that considers the environmental, social, and economic aspects of city life.

When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.

            <h9>Key Principles Of Sustainable Urban Planning</h9>
<p>1. Mixed-use development:This means creating neighborhoods where people can live, work, and shop in close proximity to each other. This reduces the need for people to travel long distances by car, which can help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.<br><br>
    2. Walkable and bikeable communities:Sustainable urban planning prioritizes creating safe and convenient spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. This includes creating sidewalks, bike lanes, and trails, as well as designing streets that are narrower and slower-paced.<br><br>
    3.Green infrastructure:This refers to the use of natural elements, such as parks, trees, and rain gardens, in urban areas. Green infrastructure can help to improve air and water quality, reduce stormwater runoff, and provide cooling in the summer.<br><br>
    4. Public transportation:Sustainable cities have reliable and affordable public transportation systems that can help people get around without a car. This can include buses, trains, trams, and subways.<br><br>
    5. Energy efficiency: Sustainable urban planning encourages the use of energy-efficient buildings and appliances. This can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save money on energy costs.

            <h9>Benifits Of Sustainable Urban Planning</h9>
            <!-- <img src="images/waterpol2.png"> -->
    <p>1. Reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>
        2. Improved public health.<br><br>
        3. Reduced traffic congestion.<br><br>
        4. More affordable housing.<br><br>
        5. Increased quality of life

<!-- Nearly 6 billion kilograms of garbage is dumped every year in the oceans. Apart from industrial effluents and untreated sewage, other forms of unwanted materials are dumped into various water bodies. These can range from nuclear waste to oil spills – the latter of which can render vast areas uninhabitable</p> -->
            
            <!-- <h9>Effects Of Water Pollution</h9>
            <p>The effect of water pollution depends upon the type of pollutants and their concentration. Also, the location of water bodies is an important factor to determine the levels of pollution.<br>

<br>-Water bodies in the vicinity of urban areas are extremely polluted. This is the result of dumping garbage and toxic chemicals by industrial and commercial establishments.<br>
<br>-Water pollution drastically affects aquatic life. It affects their metabolism, and behaviour, and causes illness and eventual death. Dioxin is a chemical that causes a lot of problems from reproduction to uncontrolled cell growth or cancer. This chemical is bioaccumulated in fish, chicken and meat. Chemicals such as this travel up the food chain before entering the human body.<br>
<br>-The effect of water pollution can have a huge impact on the food chain. It disrupts the food chain. Cadmium and lead are some toxic substances, these pollutants upon entering the food chain through animals (fish when consumed by animals, humans) can continue to disrupt at higher levels.<br>
<br>-Humans are affected by pollution and can contract diseases such as hepatitis through faecal matter in water sources. Poor drinking water treatment and unfit water can always cause an outbreak of infectious diseases such as cholera, etc.
The ecosystem can be critically affected, modified and destructured because of water pollution</p>

            <!-- <h9>Minamata Incident</h9>
            <img src="images/waterpol3.png">
            <p>In 1932, a factory in Minamata City, Japan began dumping its industrial effluent – Methylmercury, into the surrounding bay and the sea. Methylmercury is incredibly toxic to humans and animals alike, causing a wide range of neurological disorders.<br><br>

Its ill effects were not immediately noticeable. However, this all changed as methylmercury started to bioaccumulate inside shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay. These affected organisms were then caught and consumed by the local population. Soon, the ill effects of methylmercury were becoming apparent.<br><br>

Initially, animals such as cats and dogs were affected by this. The city’s cats would often convulse and make strange noises before dying – hence, the term “dancing cat disease” was coined. Soon, the same symptoms were observed in people, though the cause was not apparent at the time.<br><br>

Other affected people showed symptoms of acute mercury poisoning such as ataxia, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, damage to speech and hearing etc. In severe cases, paralysis occurred, which was followed by coma and death.  These diseases and deaths continued for almost 36 years before they could be officially acknowledged by the government and the organisation.
<br><br>
Since then, various control measures for water pollution have been adopted by the government of Japan to curb such environmental disasters in the future.</p>

            <!-- <h9>Pollution of the Ganges</h9>
            <p>Some rivers, lakes, and groundwater are rendered unfit for usage. In India, the River Ganges is the sixth most polluted river in the world. This is unsurprising as hundreds of industries nearby release their effluents into the river. Furthermore, religious activities such as burials and cremations near the shore contribute to pollution. Apart from the ecological implications, this river poses a serious health risks as it can cause diseases like typhoid and cholera.<br><br>

Pollution of the Ganges is also driving some of the distinct fauna to extinction. The Ganges River shark is a critically endangered species that belong to the order Carcharhiniformes. The Ganges River dolphin is another endangered species of dolphin that is found in the tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.<br><br>

As per a survey, by the end of 2026, around 4 billion people will face a shortage of water. Presently, around 1.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to clean, potable water and proper sanitation. It is also projected that nearly 1000 children die every year in India due to water-related issues. Groundwater is an important source of water, but unfortunately, even that is susceptible to pollution. Hence, water pollution is quite an important social issue that needs to be addressed promptly.</p>
            
            
            
            <h9>Control Measures of Water Pollution</h9>
            <p>Water pollution, to a larger extent, can be controlled by a variety of methods. Rather than releasing sewage waste into water bodies, it is better to treat them before discharge. Practising this can reduce the initial toxicity and the remaining substances can be degraded and rendered harmless by the water body itself. If the secondary treatment of water has been carried out, then this can be reused in sanitary systems and agricultural fields.<br><br>

A very special plant, the Water Hyacinth can absorb dissolved toxic chemicals such as cadmium and other such elements. Establishing these in regions prone to such kinds of pollutants will reduce the adverse effects to a large extent.<br><br>

Some chemical methods that help in the control of water pollution are precipitation, the ion exchange process, reverse osmosis, and coagulation. As an individual, reusing, reducing, and recycling wherever possible will advance a long way in overcoming the effects of water pollution.
