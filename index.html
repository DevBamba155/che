        <h1> Sustainable Transportation</h1>
       
        <p>
            Sustainable transportation and 	 are two ideas that go hand in hand. Sustainable transportation refers to ways of getting around that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. it is a way of traveling that is energy efficient, low or zero emission, and affordable

            <h>Causes</h>
            
            <p>Our reliance on car travel harms the environment through air and greenhouse gas pollution. Sustainable transportation like cycling, electric vehicles, and public transport aims to reduce this impact by using cleaner energy sources and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. This shift promotes a healthier planet and paves the way for a more sustainable future.

                    <h>Effects</h>
            <p>
                Sustainable transportation, like cycling, electric vehicles, and improved public transport, cleans our air and fights climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also promotes healthier lifestyles and creates quieter cities. While initial investments may be needed, the long-term benefits for our planet and health are undeniable.

            <p>Urban planning pulls from a rich tapestry of disciplines. It borrows the technical aspects of engineering and architecture, while incorporating social sciences to understand community needs. Public health and economics also play a role, ensuring city spaces are healthy and prosperous. Finally, urban design principles ensure functionality and aesthetics go hand-in-hand to create thriving urban environments.

                    <h2>The Neon City</h2>
                    <p>Neom, a planned city in Saudi Arabia, is aiming to be a frontrunner in sustainable transportation and urban planning. </p>

                    <h3>A. Sustainable Transportation</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. No Cars, No Emissions: Imagine a city without traditional roads or cars! Neom's centerpiece, "The Line," will be a car-free zone relying on a high-speed underground railway and electric autonomous shuttles for efficient movement within the city. This will significantly reduce air pollution and noise.<br>
                        2. Focus on Active Mobility: Walking, cycling, and micro-mobility options like e-scooters will be prioritized. The urban design will incorporate dedicated lanes and green spaces to encourage these healthy and eco-friendly ways to get around.<br>
                        3. 100% Renewable Energy: Neom plans to use only renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to run its transportation system, further minimizing its environmental impact.

                    <p>
                        1. Mixed-Use Development: Neom will be divided into zones where people can live, work, and play in close proximity. This reduces reliance on cars for commutes and fosters a strong sense of community.<br>
                        2. Walkable and Bikeable City: The Line itself will be only 200 meters wide, prioritizing pedestrian access throughout. Buildings and amenities will be strategically placed to minimize walking distances.<br>
                        3. Preserving Nature: Neom aims to conserve 95% of its natural surroundings. Buildings will integrate with the landscape, and green spaces will be woven throughout the city for a harmonious relationship between nature and urban life.<br>
                        4. Smart Technologies: Neom plans to leverage cutting-edge technology to optimize everything from traffic flow to resource management. This includes self-regulating infrastructure and AI-powered transportation systems.<br>
